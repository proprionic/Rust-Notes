These are ***my*** notes for learning Rust. Use them however you want, i'm down to share :).

# Updating

I'll be updating this repo every once in a while when i'll study, so no constant updates (due to school & work, unfortunately.)

## Software

I use obsidian (the goat!!), with the Excalidraw extension
