# Rust-Notes

These are **my** notes for learning rust. You can do whatever you like with them, i'm happy to share :).

# Updates

I'll be updating this repo whenever i'll be studying again (So, no constant updates due to school & work, unfortunately.)

# What software do i use?

I'm using Obsidian (the goat), with the excalidraw extension.
