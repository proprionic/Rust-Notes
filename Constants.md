In Rust, **variables** and **constants** are used to store data, but they differ in their behavior, usage, and constraints. Here's a clear explanation of the differences:

### **Variables**
- **Definition**: Variables in Rust are declared using the `let` keyword. By default, they are **immutable**, meaning their value cannot be changed after initialization unless explicitly marked as mutable with `mut`.
- **Mutability**: 
  - Immutable by default: `let x = 5;` (cannot reassign `x`).
  - Mutable if specified: `let mut x = 5;` (can reassign, e.g., `x = 10;`).
- **Scope**: Variables are scoped to the block they are defined in (e.g., a function or a `{}` block). They are only accessible within that scope.
- **Type**: 
  - Can be explicitly typed: `let x: i32 = 5;`.
  - Type can be inferred by the compiler if not specified: `let x = 5;` (inferred as `i32`).
- **Reassignment and Shadowing**:
  - Mutable variables can be reassigned with new values of the same type.
  - Variables can be **shadowed** by declaring a new variable with the same name in the same scope, even with a different type: `let x = 5; let x = "hello";`.
- **Memory**: Variables can hold data in stack or heap, depending on the type (e.g., `String` is heap-allocated, `i32` is stack-allocated).
- **Use Case**: Used for values that may change during program execution (if mutable) or for temporary storage within a scope.

**Example**:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // Immutable variable
    // x = 10; // Error: cannot assign to immutable variable
    let mut y = 10; // Mutable variable
    y = 20; // OK
    let x = "hello"; // Shadowing: new x with different type
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y); // x: hello, y: 20
}
```

### **Constants**
- **Definition**: Constants are declared using the `const` keyword and are **always immutable**. They represent values that are computed at compile time and cannot change during runtime.
- **Mutability**: Constants are **always immutable**; you cannot use `mut` with `const`.
- **Scope**: Constants are typically declared at the **global scope** or within a module, making them accessible throughout the program or module. They can also be defined in a function but are less commonly used there.
- **Type**: 
  - Must have an **explicit type** annotation: `const MAX: i32 = 100;`.
  - Type inference is not allowed for constants.
- **Value**: 
  - Must be a **constant expression** (evaluated at compile time). This means you can't use function calls or runtime computations to set a constant's value.
  - Examples of valid constant values: literals (`42`, `"hello"`), simple arithmetic (`2 + 3`), or other constants.
- **Naming Convention**: By convention, constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`).
- **Memory**: Constants are inlined at compile time where they are used, so they don’t have a specific memory address during runtime.
- **Use Case**: Used for fixed, unchanging values that are known at compile time, such as configuration values or mathematical constants.

**Example**:
```rust
const MAX_SCORE: i32 = 100; // Constant with explicit type
// const INVALID: i32 = some_function(); // Error: functions can't be used

fn main() {
    println!("Max score: {}", MAX_SCORE); // Max score: 100
    // MAX_SCORE = 200; // Error: constants are immutable
}
```

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                  | Variables (`let`)                          | Constants (`const`)                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Declaration**          | `let` or `let mut`                         | `const`                                   |
| **Mutability**           | Immutable by default; mutable with `mut`   | Always immutable                         |
| **Scope**                | Block-scoped (local to `{}`)               | Often global/module-scoped               |
| **Type**                 | Can be inferred or explicit                | Must be explicit                         |
| **Value**                | Can be set at runtime                     | Must be set at compile time              |
| **Reassignment**         | Allowed for `mut` variables; supports shadowing | Not allowed                            |
| **Naming Convention**    | Typically `camelCase` or `snake_case`      | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`                   |
| **Memory**               | Stack or heap, depending on type           | Inlined at compile time                  |
| **Use Case**             | Dynamic values, local storage             | Fixed, compile-time known values         |

### **Additional Notes**
- **When to Use**: Use constants for values that are fixed and known at compile time (e.g., `const PI: f64 = 3.14159;`). Use variables for values that may change or are computed during program execution.
- **Static Variables**: Rust also has `static` variables, which are similar to constants but can have a memory address and are used for global mutable state (with `unsafe` for mutation). They’re less common and not covered here, but they’re distinct from both `let` variables and `const`.

**Example Combining Both**:
```rust
const GLOBAL_LIMIT: i32 = 100;

fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;
    while counter < GLOBAL_LIMIT {
        counter += 1;
    }
    println!("Counter reached: {}", counter); // Counter reached: 100
}
```

This shows how constants (`GLOBAL_LIMIT`) and variables (`counter`) work together in a program.
